It can be difficult to get everybody into a meeting, especially these days when many meetings are online. It is important that time is not wasted in these situations, so it's good to have a plan for when the decision maker/s are busy.

<!--endintro-->

### Make it a ceremony

You have already [shared the agenda](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/share-the-agenda), so pick out the best item and ping the decision maker/s before the meeting: *"We're meeting in 30 minutes, I'm excited to be talking about xxx"*.

### Be Persistent

If the meeting should have started and the decision maker/s have not joined, add them to the call (if possible), ping them again, or call them. If you don't get a response, tell them *"I will call you towards the end of the meeting to go for a summary"*,as per [SSW.Rules | Do you know how to loop someone in at the end of a meeting?](https://www.ssw.com.au/rules/loop-someone-in)

### Be Proactive

Don't just wait around for everyone to be there - once you have done the above and the decision maker/s have a delegate, start the meeting. You may choose to start with smaller agenda items, or "For information" items that can be easily summarised at the end.
